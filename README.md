Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a health-related dataset. The goal is to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights that can guide further machine learning tasks.

Objectives:
Understand dataset structure and features
Handle missing and inconsistent data
Detect and treat outliers
Explore relationships between variables
Visualize key patterns and trends
Prepare data for modeling

Dataset:
Source: kagglehub.dataset_download("fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset")
Number of rows:  5,110
Number of columns: 12 features

Key Features:
age – Patient age
bmi – Body Mass Index
avg_glucose_level – Average glucose level
stroke – Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)


Data Cleaning Steps:
Removed duplicate rows
Handled missing values
Corrected data types
Standardized categorical values

Exploratory Analysis:
Univariate Analysis
Distribution plots for numerical features
Count plots for categorical features
Bivariate Analysis
Boxplots comparing features vs target
Correlation analysis

Key Insights:
Higher age is associated with increased stroke risk
BMI shows moderate variation across classes
Glucose level has noticeable influence on target

Visualizations:
Histograms
Boxplots
Heatmaps
Count plots
(All visualizations are available in the notebook)

Tools & Libraries:
Python
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

Conclusion:
The dataset was successfully cleaned and explored. Key patterns and relationships were identified, providing a solid foundation for building predictive models.
